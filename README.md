# ETH Transaction Data Dashboard

This dashboard displays transaction data for an inputted ethereum wallet address. It looks and functions similar to an Etherscan clone, but includes accessibility to easily manipulate the transaction data for further analysis.

Adding significant functionality is not planned as this is a rather simple project. I am primarily interested in including overall address statistics and possibly NFT profit/loss analysis.


# To-Do
1. Internal transactions
2. Table Pagination
