# ETH Transaction Data Dashboard

This dashboard displays transaction data for an inputted ethereum wallet address. It functions similar to a simple Etherscan clone, but offers an extensible codebase to easily add functionality for further transaction data analysis.

Adding significant functionality is not planned as this is a rather simple project.
